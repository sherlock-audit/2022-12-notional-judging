# TwoTokenPoolUtils.sol : _getTimeWeightedPrimaryBalance - truncated `primary` amount due to solidity division truncation

## Summary

_getTimeWeightedPrimaryBalance function is called to get the primary amount.

        uint256 totalBPTSupply = poolContext.basePool.pool.totalSupply();
        uint256 primaryBalance = poolContext.primaryBalance * bptAmount / totalBPTSupply;
        uint256 secondaryBalance = poolContext.secondaryBalance * bptAmount / totalBPTSupply;

When we look at the above lines inside the function `_getTimeWeightedPrimaryBalance`,  the `primaryBalance`  and `secondaryBalance`  balance are calculated with combination of division followed by the multiplication.

It is well know behaviors of solidity that division would round down the value.

Refer the following like to understand it more https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#divide-before-multiply:~:text=Divide%20before%20multiply

## Vulnerability Detail

        uint256 primaryBalance = poolContext.primaryBalance * bptAmount / totalBPTSupply;
        uint256 secondaryBalance = poolContext.secondaryBalance * bptAmount / totalBPTSupply;

## Impact

calcualted primary amount value  rounded down unnecessarily.

When the `totalBPTSupply > bptAmount` , then the division will result a zero value. This would eventually end with zero return from the function.

## Recommendation

Update the calculation as given below.

        -uint256 primaryBalance = poolContext.primaryBalance * bptAmount / totalBPTSupply;
        -uint256 secondaryBalance = poolContext.secondaryBalance * bptAmount / totalBPTSupply;

        +uint256 primaryBalance = (poolContext.primaryBalance * bptAmount) / totalBPTSupply;
        +uint256 secondaryBalance = (poolContext.secondaryBalance * bptAmount) / totalBPTSupply;
