# Staked BPT will not receive rewards from Aura

## Summary

The BPT staked by the vaults will not receive rewards from Aura as Aura no longer sends rewards to the old reward contracts. As a result, the leverage vaults lose the opportunity to claim the rewards and the value of the strategy token will not appreciate as expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the [announcement](https://discord.com/channels/952228254910136330/971913083326967808/1050622931958501376), Aura Finance has migrated their Booster and, therefore, all their reward pool contracts. This means that all BPT tokens staked within the old reward pool contracts will cease to receive rewards after this.

Following are the old and new Aura's reward pool addresses:

| LP Token       | Old (V1)                                   | New (V2)                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| B-stETH-STABLE | 0xdcee1c640cc270121faf145f231fd8ff1d8d5cd4 | 0xe4683fe8f53da14ca5dac4251eadfb3aa614d528 |
| bb-a-USD       | 0x1e9f147241da9009417811ad5858f22ed1f9f9fd | 0xfb6b1c1a1ea5618b3cfc20f81a11a97e930fa46b |

It was observed that Aura's reward pool of the leverage vaults is still pointing to the old reward contract.

## Impact

The BPT that the leverage vaults staked at Aura's old reward contract will not accrue rewards. The vault will not receive the rewards, and it will not be able to reinvest the rewards to purchase more BPT on behalf of the holders of the vault's strategy tokens. Loss of assets as the leverage vaults lose the opportunity to claim the rewards and the value of the strategy token that users hold will not appreciate as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the leverage vaults stake the BPT to the new Aura's reward pool.

Following are the old and new Aura's reward pool addresses:

| LP Token       | Old (V1)                                   | New (V2)                                   |
