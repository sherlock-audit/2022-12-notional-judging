# Absence of ```underlyingBalances``` array length check after getting tokens from ```Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT.getPoolTokens(BALANCER_POOL_ID)```

## Summary
There is no condition check for length of UnderlyingBalances/balances array of tokens after getting those from ```BALANCER VAULT``` 

## Vulnerability Detail
Here the code doesnot check that info regarding 3tokens are actually recieved from ```Balancer Vault``` correctly or not.
If call fails some reason then it simply returned default value(i.e zero address), which by unknowingly these functions ```_underlyingPoolContext()``` and ```_getBalancesAndScaleFactors()``` transmitting forward, Which may cause some serous damage to protocol.

```solidity
 (
            /* address[] memory tokens */,
            uint256[] memory underlyingBalances,
            /* uint256 lastChangeBlock */
        ) = Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT.getPoolTokens(underlyingPool.getPoolId());
```
```solidity
function _getBalancesAndScaleFactors() internal view returns (uint256[] memory balances, uint256[] memory scalingFactors) {
        (
            /* address[] memory tokens */,
            balances,
            /* uint256 lastChangeBlock */
        ) = Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT.getPoolTokens(BALANCER_POOL_ID); // @audit-issue length check

        scalingFactors = IBalancerPool(address(BALANCER_POOL_TOKEN)).getScalingFactors();
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a check on tokens / balances array's length after after getting those from  ```BALANCER VAULT``` via ```Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT.getPoolTokens(BALANCER_POOL_ID)```
