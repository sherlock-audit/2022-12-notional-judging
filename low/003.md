# Inconsistent value declaration for Balancer deployment vaults variables

## Summary

Some variables do not correspond to the ones declared on the corresponding comments. This end up impacting on the `deployBalancerVault` method.

## Vulnerability Detail

### settlementWindow

```python
"settlementWindow": 172800, # 1-week settlement
```

`settlementWindow` for `StratStableETHstETH` was modified to `172800`, which corresponds to `2 days` (`3600 * 24 * 2`), while 1-week is documented as the value.

For reference, other `settlementWindow` pool configuration are still set to 1 week (`StratBoostedPoolDAIPrimary`, `StratBoostedPoolUSDCPrimary`):

### feeRate5BPS

```python
kwargs.get("feeRate5BPS", 0), # 4: 1% fee
```

`feeRate5BPS` was introduced as `0`, while a `1%` fee is documented.

### settlementSlippageLimitPercent

```python
"settlementSlippageLimitPercent": 3e6, # 5%
```

`settlementSlippageLimitPercent` for `StratStableETHstETH` was modified to `3e6` (3%), while 5% is documented as the value.

For reference, other `settlementSlippageLimitPercent` pool configuration are still set to 5%(`StratBoostedPoolDAIPrimary`, `StratBoostedPoolUSDCPrimary`):

## Impact

Incorrect values when deploying Balancer vaults may lead to unexpected system behavior, like incorrect window settlement, no fee rates applied, or incremented slippage.
