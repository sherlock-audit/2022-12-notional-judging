# `redeemFromNotional` may not be able to withdraw `ETH`

## Summary
`ETH` might be impossible to withdraw in `_UNDERLYING_IS_ETH` path if fixed amount of `transfer()` change

## Vulnerability Detail
Use of `transfer()` might render `ETH` impossible to withdraw because after istanbul hardfork, there is increases in the gas cost of the `SLOAD` operation and therefore breaks some existing smart contracts. Those contracts will break because their fallback functions used to consume less than `2300` gas, and they’ll now consume more, since `2300` the amount of gas a contract’s fallback function receives if it’s called via Solidity’s `transfer()` or `send()` methods.

Any smart contract that uses `transfer()` or `send()` is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: `2300`.

## Impact
Function that withdraws `ETH`  can be unuseable

## Recommendation
Use `call()` to send `ETH` rather than `transfer()`
