# Lack of access control in `__INIT_VAULT` can lead to malicious / wrong values assigned when `initialize`

## Summary
Contracts that inherit from `BaseStrategyVault` and not include access control when calling their initialize function will be vulnerable to frontrunning calls to `initialize`.

## Vulnerability Detail
While `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is assigned to `NOTIONAL.owner()`, and `NOTIONAL` is assigned in the constructor (safe):

```
constructor(NotionalProxy notional_, ITradingModule tradingModule_) initializer {
    NOTIONAL = notional_;
    TRADING_MODULE = tradingModule_;
}
```

Values that uses `name` and `borrowCurrencyId` to be assigned/calculated, are vulnerable to who calls `__INIT_VAULT`:

```
function __INIT_VAULT(
    string memory name_,
    uint16 borrowCurrencyId_
) internal onlyInitializing {
    _NAME = name_;
    _BORROW_CURRENCY_ID = borrowCurrencyId_;

    address underlyingAddress = _getNotionalUnderlyingToken(borrowCurrencyId_);
    _UNDERLYING_TOKEN = IERC20(underlyingAddress);
    _UNDERLYING_IS_ETH = underlyingAddress == address(0);
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, NOTIONAL.owner());
}
```

As this function doesn't have a `onlyNotionalOwner`, `onlyOwner` or similar access control. When `BaseStrategyVault.sol` is inherited, the method that calls `__INIT_VAULT` must include access control for this, as `__INIT_VAULT` doesn't include it. 

However, it can be found, for example in [`CrossCurrencyfCashVault.sol#initialize()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional/blob/main/contracts/vaults/CrossCurrencyfCashVault.sol#L79-L85), that `initialize` can be called by anyone. A malicious person can deny `Vaults` to be initialized with desired values by frontrunning `initialize` (or just by calling it first).

```
function initialize(
    string memory name_,
    uint16 borrowCurrencyId_,
    uint16 lendCurrencyId_,
    uint64 settlementSlippageLimit_
) external initializer {
    __INIT_VAULT(name_, borrowCurrencyId_);
```

## Impact
Expected values being denied / wrongly assigned and later used.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control to `__INIT_VAULT` from `BaseStrategyVault.sol` or take it into account with contracts that inherit it
