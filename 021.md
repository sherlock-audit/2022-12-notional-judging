# StrategyUtils::_executeTradeExactIn may use an incorrect trade.amount when executing a trade

## Summary

`StrategyUtils::_executeTradeExactIn` relies on the calculated `trade.amount` when executing a trade. The value of `trade.amount` could be incorrect as it relies on the contract balances which can be influenced by other factors.

## Vulnerability Detail

`trade.amount` is calculated as:

https://github.com/notional-finance/leveraged-vaults/blob/071e16d77daaa68dc4cab80a3efe650164f411ec/contracts/vaults/balancer/internal/strategy/StrategyUtils.sol#L41-L91

```solidity
                trade.sellToken = Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.stETH();
                uint256 amountBeforeUnwrap = IERC20(trade.sellToken).balanceOf(address(this));
                // NOTE: the amount returned by unwrap is not always accurate for some reason
                Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.unwrap(trade.amount);
                trade.amount = IERC20(trade.sellToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - amountBeforeUnwrap;
```

Assuming that the value of `IERC20(trade.sellToken).balanceOf(address(this))` will only change due to unwrapping `trade.amount` is risky. There are possibilites of the balance changing because of factors such as another trade being executed concurrently. This would mean the calculated trade.amount will be incorrect leading to major accounting issues.

Also note that the `amountSold` return value would be wrong as its value is calculated as `amountSold = amount;`.

## Impact

`StrategyUtils::_executeTradeExactIn` is called by many contracts including `TwoTokenPoolUtils`, `Boosted3TokenAuraRewardUtils`, and `TwoTokenAuraRewardUtils`. Therefore the impact of using an incorrect `trade.amount` would lead to adversely affecting vault balances and their operation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is better to use the `Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.unwrap(trade.amount);` as `trade.amount`. Relying on balance change is likely to have more critical side effects.
