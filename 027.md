# Boosted3TokenPoolUtils.sol : Preminted BPT token amount is not consistent between `ComposableStablePool.sol` and `Boosted3TokenPoolUtils.s`ol

## Summary

Boosted3TokenPoolUtils.sol  contract's pre-minted the BPT is higher than the `ComposableStablePool.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the `ComposableStablePool.sol` pre-minted BPT amount,

    // The maximum imposed by the Vault, which stores balances in a packed format, is 2**(112) - 1.
    // We are preminting half of that value (rounded up).
    uint256 private constant _PREMINTED_TOKEN_BALANCE = 2**(111);
   
    _PREMINTED_TOKEN_BALANCE  = 2.59614842926741381426524816461e+33
   

Boosted3TokenPoolUtils.sol's pre-minted amount is,

    // Preminted BPT is sometimes called Phantom BPT, as the preminted BPT (which is deposited in the Vault as balance of
    // the Pool) doesn't belong to any entity until transferred out of the Pool. The Pool's arithmetic behaves as if it
    // didn't exist, and the BPT total supply is not a useful value: we rely on the 'virtual supply' (how much BPT is
    // actually owned by some entity) instead.
    uint256 private constant _MAX_TOKEN_BALANCE = 2**(112) - 1;

    _MAX_TOKEN_BALANCE  = 5.1922968585348276285304963292201e+33

Boosted3TokenPoolUtils.sol contract is pre-minting double the value of ComposableStablePool.sol

## Impact

while the BPT inside the contract will not have much impact but when it is circulated, it behaves as virtual price. This could bring inconsistence between booster and notional protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is suggested to follow the booster's pre-minted token amount for notional as well.
