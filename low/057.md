# Lack of checks at constructor

## Summary
Zero address can be set and therefore force all the contract to be redeployed as this values are immutable

## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of checks at:
```
  constructor(NotionalProxy notional_, ITradingModule tradingModule_) initializer {
        NOTIONAL = notional_;
        TRADING_MODULE = tradingModule_;
    }
```
## Impact
Redeploy, contract not working as expected / reverting
