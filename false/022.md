# StrategyUtils::_executeTradeExactIn may return an incorrect amountBought after executing a trade

## Summary

The return value `amountBought` of the `StrategyUtils::_executeTradeExactIn` function may be incorrect as it relies in changes in contract balances which can be influenced by other factors.

## Vulnerability Detail

`StrategyUtils::_executeTradeExactIn` returns `amountBought` which is calculated as:

```solidity
                uint256 amountBeforeWrap = Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.balanceOf(address(this));
                /// @notice the amount returned by wrap is not always accurate for some reason
                Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.wrap(amountBought);
                amountBought = Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.balanceOf(address(this)) - amountBeforeWrap;
```
Assuming that the value of `Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.balanceOf(address(this));` will only change due to wrapping `amountBought` is risky. There are possibilites of the balance changing because of factors such as another trade being executed concurrently. This would mean the calculated `amountBought` will be incorrect leading to major accounting issues.

## Impact

`StrategyUtils::_executeTradeExactIn` is called by many contracts including `TwoTokenPoolUtils`, `Boosted3TokenAuraRewardUtils`, and `TwoTokenAuraRewardUtils`. Therefore the impact of using an incorrect `amountBought` would lead to adversely affecting vault balances and their operation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is better to use the `Deployments.WRAPPED_STETH.wrap(amountBought);` as `amountBought`. Relying on balance change is likely to have more critical side effects.
