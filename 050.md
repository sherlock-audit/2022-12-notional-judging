# Storage gaps mismanagement may corrupt contract state

## Summary
Mismanagement of storage gaps in `BaseStrategyVault` may cause a corrupted storage state of a contract that inherits from it, due to shifted storage slots.
## Vulnerability Detail
All upgradable contracts of the project use 40 storage gaps (expect `BalancerStrategyBase`, which [uses 100](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional/blob/main/contracts/vaults/balancer/BalancerStrategyBase.sol#L31)) to reserve storage slots for future upgrades. However, the number of storage gaps in `BaseStrategyVault` is 45 ([BaseStrategyVault.sol#L212](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional/blob/main/contracts/vaults/BaseStrategyVault.sol#L212)). With [the 4 state variables](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional/blob/main/contracts/vaults/BaseStrategyVault.sol#L29-L38) of the contract, the total number of storage slots is 47 (the 4 state variables are packed into 2 slots), which is not consistent with other upgradeable contracts. Two assumptions may be made based on this fact, with both of them signaling storage gaps mismanagement:
1. If the initial number of storage gaps was 50, then the current number should be `50 reserves slots - 2 used slots = 48`. If this mistake is made during upgrading of a deployed contract, then storage slots of the contract that inherits from `BaseStrategyVault` will shift up by 3, which will corrupt the state of the contract.
1. If the initial number of storage gaps was 40 (as it is in the other upgradable contracts), then the current number should be `40 reserves slots - 2 user slots  = 38`. If this mistake is made during upgrading of a deployed contract, then storage slots of the contract that inherits from `BaseStrategyVault` will shift down by 5, which will disrupt the state of the contract.
## Impact
Storage layout of contracts inheriting from `BaseStrategyVault` may be disrupted due to storage gaps mismanagement, leading to corrupted state of the contracts.
## Code Snippet
[BaseStrategyVault.sol#L212](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional/blob/main/contracts/vaults/BaseStrategyVault.sol#L212):
```solidity
uint256[45] private __gap;
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider using an identical number of storage gaps in all upgradeable contracts. Also ensure that the number is only decremented when a new state variable is added, and never incremented, so that the total number of slots remains unchanged. Also ensure that [state variables packing](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage) is taken into consideration when counting used storage slots.
