# `Transfer()` is used instead of `call`


### Summary

`Transfer()` is used instead of `Call()` to transfer ETH which may break the code under some conditions.

### Vulnerability Detail

The use of .transfer() or .send() to send ether is now considered bad practice as gas costs can change, which would break the code.

Used in `redeemFromNotional` : line 188-189

```solidity
if (_UNDERLYING_IS_ETH) {
            if (transferToReceiver > 0) payable(receiver).transfer(transferToReceiver);
            if (transferToNotional > 0) payable(address(NOTIONAL)).transfer(transferToNotional);
        } else {
            if (transferToReceiver > 0) _UNDERLYING_TOKEN.checkTransfer(receiver, transferToReceiver);
            if (transferToNotional > 0) _UNDERLYING_TOKEN.checkTransfer(address(NOTIONAL), transferToNotional);
        }
    }
```

### Impact

Assets will fail to transfer to Notional or vault shareholders.

### Recommendation

Use call instead of transfer to send ETH.
