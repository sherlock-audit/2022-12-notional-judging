# Two token vault will be broken if it comprises tokens with different decimals

## Summary

A two token vault that comprises tokens with different decimals will have many of its key functions broken. For instance, rewards cannot be reinvested and vault cannot be settled.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Stable2TokenOracleMath._getSpotPrice` function is used to compute the spot price of two tokens.

51:     }
```

Two tokens (USDC and DAI) with different decimals will be used below to illustrate the issue:

#### USDC/DAI Spot Price

Assume that the primary token is DAI (18 decimals) and the secondary token is USDC (6 decimals). As such, the scaling factors would be as follows. The token rate is ignored and set to 1 for simplicity.

- Primary Token (DAI)'s scaling factor = 1e18

  ```solidity
  scaling factor = FixedPoint.ONE (1e18) * decimals difference to reach 18 decimals (1e0) * token rate (1)
  scaling factor = 1e18
  ```

- Secondary Token (USDC)'s scaling factor = 1e30

  ```solidity
  scaling factor = FixedPoint.ONE (1e18) * decimals difference to reach 18 decimals (1e12) * token rate (1)
  scaling factor = 1e18 * 1e12 = 1e30
  ```

Assume that the `primaryBalance` is 100 DAI (100e18), and the `secondaryBalance` is 100 USDC (100e6). Line 25 - 28 of the `_getSpotPrice` function will normalize the tokens balances to 18 decimals as follows:

- `scaledPrimaryBalance` will be 100e18 (It remains the same as no scaling is needed because DAI is already denominated in 18 decimals)

  ```solidity
  scaledPrimaryBalance = primaryBalance * poolContext.primaryScaleFactor / BalancerConstants.BALANCER_PRECISION;
  scaledPrimaryBalance = 100e18 * 1e18 / 1e18
  scaledPrimaryBalance = 100e18
  ```

- `scaledSecondaryBalance` will upscale to 100e18

  ```solidity
  scaledSecondaryBalance = scaledSecondaryBalance * poolContext.primaryScaleFactor / BalancerConstants.BALANCER_PRECISION;
  scaledSecondaryBalance = 100e6 * 1e30 / 1e18
  scaledSecondaryBalance = 100e18
  ```

The `StableMath._calcSpotPrice` function at Line 39 returns the spot price of Y/X. In this example, `balanceX` is DAI, and `balanceY` is USDC. Thus, the spot price will be USDC/DAI. This means the amount of USDC I will get for each DAI.

Within Balancer, all stable math calculations within the Balancer's pools are performed in 1e18. With both the primary and secondary balances normalized to 18 decimals, they can be safely passed to the `StableMath._calculateInvariant` and `StableMath._calcSpotPrice` functions to compute the spot price. Assuming that the price of USDC and DAI is perfectly symmetric (1 DAI can be exchanged for exactly 1 USDC, and vice versa), the spot price returned from the `StableMath._calcSpotPrice` will be `1e18`. Note that the spot price returned by the `StableMath._calcSpotPrice` function will be denominated in 18 decimals.

In Line 47-50 within the `Stable2TokenOracleMath._getSpotPrice` function, it attempts to downscale the spot price to normalize it back to the original decimals and token rate (e.g. stETH back to wstETH) of the token.

The `scaleFactor` at Line 47 will be evaluated as follows:

```solidity
scaleFactor = poolContext.secondaryScaleFactor * BalancerConstants.BALANCER_PRECISION / poolContext.primaryScaleFactor
scaleFactor = 1e30 * 1e18 / 1e18
scaleFactor = 1e30
```

Finally, the spot price will be scaled in reverse order and it will be evaluated to `1e6` as shown below:

```solidity
spotPrice = spotPrice * BalancerConstants.BALANCER_PRECISION / scaleFactor;
spotPrice = 1e18 * 1e18 / 1e30
spotPrice = 1e6
```

#### DAI/USDC Spot Price

If it is the opposite where the primary token is USDC (6 decimals) and the secondary token is DAI (18 decimals), the calculation of the spot price will be as follows:

The `scaleFactor` at Line 47 will be evaluated to as follows:

```
scaleFactor = poolContext.secondaryScaleFactor * BalancerConstants.BALANCER_PRECISION / poolContext.primaryScaleFactor
scaleFactor = 1e18 * 1e18 / 1e30
scaleFactor = 1e6
```

Finally, the spot price will be scaled in reverse order and it will be evaluated to `1e30` as shown below:

```
spotPrice = spotPrice * BalancerConstants.BALANCER_PRECISION / scaleFactor;
spotPrice = 1e18 * 1e18 / 1e6
spotPrice = 1e30
```

#### Note about the spot price

Assuming that the spot price of USDC and DAI is 1:1. As shown above, if the decimals of two tokens are not the same, the final spot price will end up either 1e6 (USDC/DAI) or 1e30 (DAI/USDC). However, if the decimals of two tokens (e.g. wstETH and WETH) are the same, this issue stays hidden as the `scaleFactor` in Line 47 will always be 1e18 as both `secondaryScaleFactor` and `primaryScaleFactor` cancel out each other.

It was observed that the spot price returned from the `Stable2TokenOracleMath._getSpotPrice` function is being compared with the oracle price from the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getOraclePairPrice` function to determine if the pool has been manipulated within many functions.

```solidity
uint256 oraclePrice = poolContext._getOraclePairPrice(strategyContext.tradingModule);
```

Based on the implementation of the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getOraclePairPrice` function , the `oraclePrice` returned by this function is always denominated in 18 decimals regardless of the decimals of the underlying tokens. For instance, assume the spot price of USDC (6 decimals) and DAI (18 decimals) is 1:1. The spot price returned by this oracle function for USDC/DAI will be `1e18` and DAI/USDC will be `1e18`.

In many functions, the spot price returned from the `Stable2TokenOracleMath._getSpotPrice` function is compared with the oracle price via the `Stable2TokenOracleMath._checkPriceLimit`. Following is one such example. The `oraclePrice` will be `1e18`, while the `spotPrice` will be either `1e6` or `1e30` in our example. This will cause the `_checkPriceLimit` to always revert because of the large discrepancy between the two prices.

```solidity
File: Stable2TokenOracleMath.sol
71:     function _getMinExitAmounts(
72:         StableOracleContext calldata oracleContext,
73:         TwoTokenPoolContext calldata poolContext,
74:         StrategyContext calldata strategyContext,
75:         uint256 oraclePrice,
76:         uint256 bptAmount
77:     ) internal view returns (uint256 minPrimary, uint256 minSecondary) {
78:         // Oracle price is always specified in terms of primary, so tokenIndex == 0 for primary
79:         // Validate the spot price to make sure the pool is not being manipulated
80:         uint256 spotPrice = _getSpotPrice({
81:             oracleContext: oracleContext,
82:             poolContext: poolContext,
83:             primaryBalance: poolContext.primaryBalance,
84:             secondaryBalance: poolContext.secondaryBalance,
85:             tokenIndex: 0
86:         });
87:         _checkPriceLimit(strategyContext, oraclePrice, spotPrice);
```

Other affected functions include the following:

- Stable2TokenOracleMath._validateSpotPriceAndPairPrice
- Stable2TokenOracleMath._getTimeWeightedPrimaryBalance

## Impact

A vault supporting tokens with two different decimals will have many of its key functions will be broken as the `_checkPriceLimit` will always revert.  For instance, rewards cannot be reinvested and vaults cannot be settled since they rely on the `_checkPriceLimit` function.

If the reward cannot be reinvested, the strategy tokens held by the users will not appreciate. If the vault cannot be settled, the vault debt cannot be repaid to Notional and the gain cannot be realized. Loss of assets for both users and Notional

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Within the `Stable2TokenOracleMath._getSpotPrice`, normalize the spot price back to 1e18 before returning the result. This ensures that it can be compared with the oracle price, which is denominated in 1e18 precision.

This has been implemented in the spot price function (`Boosted3TokenPoolUtils._getSpotPriceWithInvariant`) of another pool (`Boosted3Token`). However, it was not consistently applied in `TwoTokenPool`.
