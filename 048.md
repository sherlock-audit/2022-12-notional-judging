# Poor validation or prices reported by Chainlink oracles

## Summary
The `TradingModule` contract integrates with Chainlink feeds, however prices reported by Chainlink feeds are not thoroughly validated. This exposes the protocol the negative impact of extreme market events, possible malicious activity of Chainlink data feeders or its contracts, potential delays, and outages.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `getOraclePrice` function of `TradingModule` reads a price from a Chainlink feed and ignores
`roundID` and `answeredInRound` values returned by `latestRoundData` ([TradingModule.sol#L242-L248](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional/blob/main/contracts/trading/TradingModule.sol#L242-L248)). `roundID` and `answeredInRound` values can be used to check for price reporting round completeness. However, the values are ignored and not validated, which exposes the protocol to any Chainlink issues with completing price reporting rounds.

Also, the `basePrice` and `quotePrice` values are not checked against reasonable price limits: while there's a check for a zero price, an invalid price may still be above zero.
## Impact
In case a Chainlink price feed has failed to finalize a round, `TradingModule` won't detect a stale or an invalid price, which will affect all operations that use Chainlink prices.

In case a price that's outside of the reasonable limits of an asset is reported (due to an outage in Chainlink or malicious activity), `TradingModule` will fail to detect such price. As a result, any operation that uses Chainlink prices will be affected.
## Code Snippet
[TradingModule.sol#L242-L248](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional/blob/main/contracts/trading/TradingModule.sol#L242-L248)
```solidity
(/* */, int256 basePrice, /* */, uint256 bpUpdatedAt, /* */) = baseOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
require(block.timestamp - bpUpdatedAt <= maxOracleFreshnessInSeconds);
require(basePrice > 0); /// @dev: Chainlink Rate Error

(/* */, int256 quotePrice, /* */, uint256 qpUpdatedAt, /* */) = quoteOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
require(block.timestamp - qpUpdatedAt <= maxOracleFreshnessInSeconds);
require(quotePrice > 0); /// @dev: Chainlink Rate Error
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider following the [Monitoring data feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#monitoring-data-feeds) recommendations from Chainlink and:
1. start checking the `roundID` and `answeredInRound` values: ensure `answeredInRound` is always greater or equal to `roundID` ([See for more details](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values));
1. start reading the `maxAnswer` and `minAnswer` from the Chainlink aggregator and ensure that prices reported by `latestRoundData` are always within the reasonable limit;
1. however, be warned that the `maxAnswer` and `minAnswer` values are not immutable and they may change when the Chainlink aggregator is [changed](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/e1e78865d4f3e609e7977777d7fb0604913b63ed/contracts/src/v0.7/dev/AggregatorProxy.sol#L322-L338).
