# call() should be used instead of transfer() on an address payable

## Summary
`call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an address payable

`call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an address payable

## Impact
The use of the deprecated transfer() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

Example:
The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

## Code Snippet
``` solidity
            if (transferToReceiver > 0) payable(receiver).transfer(transferToReceiver);
            if (transferToNotional > 0) payable(address(NOTIONAL)).transfer(transferToNotional);
```

## Tool used
Manual code review with VS code

## Recommendation
Use call() instead of transfer(),
like
if (transferToReceiver > 0) payable(receiver).call(transferToReceiver);
